# Store Web App

This is a basic e-commerce web application where users can browse through a variety of products and add them to their shopping cart. The application is designed to provide a seamless shopping experience, with a user-friendly interface and easy navigation.

## Technologies Used

The application is built using a combination of modern technologies for both the frontend and backend:

- **React.js**: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single page applications.

- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces. It provides low-level utility classes that let you build completely custom designs without ever leaving your HTML.

- **Node.js**: An open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. It's used in this project to build the server-side of the application.

- **Express**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. It's used in this project to handle HTTP requests and to build the API.

- **SQLite**: A C library that provides a lightweight disk-based database. It allows accessing the database using a nonstandard variant of the SQL query language. It's used in this project to store and retrieve data for the application.

## Features

- Product Browsing: Users can browse through a variety of products available in the store.
- Shopping Cart: Users can add products to their shopping cart and view the cart at any time to see their selected products.

## To run:
 - cd frontend -> npm start
 - cd backend -> node server.js
